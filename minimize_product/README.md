# Minimize Product
Here is the [question](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/segment-trees/practice-problems/algorithm/minimize-product-265ce7a0/)

minimize_product_segment_tree.py: 
1) This gave me a score of 20. 
2) Segment Trees are not the best approach as it has a lot of memory requirements plus I am also being quite generous in using up memory.
3) Next approach try fenwick trees.
